# 02-Advanced-CSS-02-Homework

## Description

This is the start of my Professional Portfolio

- This is something I really want to understand and make the best I can
- To try to put together all of the things I have learned as of now.
- I learned that what I thought was javascript is really CSS.

##  Useage

- I ran into issues with getting some of the items to work.  I have requested a Tutor and have my first session with him on the 29th to go over the CSS Blocks in my mind.
